# SG-Haze-App
A handy Fitbit app that pulls PSI readings from data.gov.sg and displays it right on your wrist!

Context:

Every year in September, Singapore and its neighbours will encounted a bout of haze. Merely looking out at the sky to determine the air quality is actually a very unreliable way to determine the air quality. Fortunately, haze related data is readily available on Singapore's own data repository, data.gov.sg. Most of the data made available have APIs for developers available, making implementation of their data very convenient.

This project was a really simple and a good way for me to learn about developing apps on the Fitbit and also getting data online. I hope this could help you in your learning too!
